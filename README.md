In this module we were to build a Javascript for earthquake data. This data was a week's worth of earthquakes
We used a link provided to obtain the data for this module and added it to a Javascipt file to make a GeoJson Map. We were to make several dimensions of the map.
The dimensions I used were grayscale, topography and watercolor. I added those into the JS and was able to make
the basemaps to toggle between for each one. 

Another aspectI was able to do was add the tectonic plates to it. I used a github master copy provided and was able to get it added into the GeoJson.
I also made this clickable by adding to the control in the top right corner. These are displayed in yellow on the map.
I then added the earthquake data to the program and gave each depth a different color according to it's range on a scale.
I made the radius of the point on the map larger or smaller depending on the magnitude of the earthquake that was recorded.

I then created a legend to show what the colors determine based on the intervals of the depth.

In this data I was able to conclude that majority of the earthquakes in the United States are located in Alaska and California. 
In the world there was a lot of earthquakes between Asia and Austrailia and again in the US in California and Alaska.
As far as magnitude goes, Indonesia and the Phillipines had the larger of the earthquakes compared to the much lower magnitude of the ones that occured in the United States.

In terms of depth, South American had most earthquakes with a depth of 90+. however the ones off the coast of australia and indonesia reach 500+ in some areas.

It was very interesting to be able to look at just how many were recorded in a week's time all over the world.
